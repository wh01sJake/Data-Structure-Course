If we look at the method signature, we see that the method is public, it returns a Boolean (True or False) and the method is called isEmpty. We can also see that the method has no parameters. To check if a LinkedList is empty the simple logic call of first == null is suitable. Remember when we create an empty LinkedList we set first == null.

      When annotating Java documents we typically identify the paramaters and the return type like below:

      @param N/A

    /*
      Ths is the size method, an essential method to be able to iterate over the collection of Nodes and count each step. We are just trying to count how many objects are in the LinkedList. Remember Mario's idea of a vehical moving across the LinkedList. The idea is straight forward and for a Single LinkedList we move in one direction. We start at the first Node, because we have a reference to that Node (remember our instance variables above). We then simply need to go through the LinkedList one Node at a time and on each change to a new Node we increment our counter variable. For example,

      We need a counter variable so we define: int count = 0; => this means that we have just defined a variable, remember Java has no idea of what you are doing its not going to help, this variable is called "count", it is of type int and we have initialised it to start counting at 0.

      We need to grab a reference to the first Node in the LinkedList, this is cool as we defined an instance variable which gives us this reference point. In java we do the following:

      Node node = first; => Creating a variable of type Node that is called "node" to be the same as first

      The Loop helps us to perform something a number of times until a condition is met, this is how our vehicle moves over the collection of odjects (our LinkedList)! Using a While Loop makes most sense here.

      The condition is going to be simple, while Node is not null grab the next node and increase the counter variable by 1:

      while (node != null) { => This is the condition
          count++;// increasing the counter by 1
          node = node.next;//this is where we assign the node to be the next node in the list
      }

      As we can see above the actual movement is simple the variable node is assigned the value of the next node.

      @param N/A
      @return int, the number of Nodes in the LinkedList
    */
    public int size() {
        int count = 0;
        Node node = first;
        while (node != null) {
            count++;
            node = node.next;
        }
        return count;
    }

    /*
     This method returns the average of all the grades included in the linkedlist,
     it traverses through the list while (just like the movement above in the size method) but instead of just incrementing a counter variable by 1 it adds the result of the module
     within each into a variable and then divides it by the list's size, if the list is empty 0.0 is returned. This is the same stragety as before we are just changing the calculation!!

     Our LinkedList looks something like the following:

     N1 [S1, N2] -> N2 [S2, N3] -> N3[S3, N4].....NULL

     N1 is a Node and the Node consists of a Subject Object (S1) and a Node Object (N2) which is the pointer to the next Node in the LinkedList.

     NUMBER OF NODES ... we have a method called size() which returns the number of Nodes
     AVERAGE GRADE ... this should be easy if we can get access to the grade number!!! But we do need access to the grade within the module. Remember we defined the Node that contained the information about a subject(module name and grade). We also defined methods to be able to get access to these variables, for example,

     N1.s.getGrade() --> returns the value for the grade in Node N1

     Putting all this together we get the following in java:

     double sum = 0; // this is our variable that will hold the value of the sum of all the grades.
     double answer = 0.0; // we need a variable to hold the result that will be returned
     if (!isEmpty()) {//the linked list if empty return 0.0;
         Node node = first;// we start at the start of the linkedlist
         while (node != null) {//we iterate until the Node is null this is the end of the linkedlist
             sum = sum + node.s.getGrade();// node.s.getGrade is just a number
             node = node.next;// this performs the movement along the collection
         }
         answer = sum / size();// this calculates the average
     }
     return answer;
     @param N/A
     @return double, the average grade in an Academic Record
     */
    public double get_average() {
        double sum = 0;
        double answer = 0.0;
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            Node node = first;
            while (node != null){
                sum = sum + node.s.getGrade();
                node = node.next;
            }
            answer = sum / size();
        }
        return answer;
    }

    /*
       This method removes an object from the LinkedList. The object to be removed is indentified by passing in the name of the module to be removed as a paramater into the method signature.
       We need to check if there is a Subject in the LinkedList with the name of the module being passed in.
       Remember we need to be able to move through the collection and at each Node check if the name of the module is found. There are a few special cases to be aware of:

       case 1: we don't find the module, then we should simply return something that tells us this, for example;

       we are going to incrememt a counter when checking if the module is in the linkedlist. After going through the full linkedlist the counter should be the same as the number of elements within the list, so all we have to do is check if the counter is the same as the size of the linkedlist and if so return "Not Found"

       if(counter == size()){
         return "Not Found";
       }

       using the size() method we can check if the node to be removed is the last node in the LinkedList, for example,

       Remember to remove a node we simply need to change the reference to the next Node in the Linkedlist.
       if (counter == size() - 1) {
           this.last = node;
           this.last.next = null;
       }

       @param target, this should be the name of a module to be removed.
